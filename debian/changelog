    but we had the offending code in the script verbatim)
  * move nagios2-doc to section docs
  * re-work notifications to be slightly more verbose. For example, an
    acknowledgement notification now actually includes the comment.

nagios2 (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First build with upstream's release version

  [sean finney]
  * cleanup/simplification of http admin username/password handling
    in maintscripts.
  * documentation in README.Debian regarding this.
  * fix in the determining $servers in postinst.
  * the directory removals in the postrm have been updated to reflect
    the nagios2 directory layout.
  * conditionally stop the nagios2 daemon in the nagios2 packages' prerm,
    for cases where it is being purged before nagios2-common's prerm
    does so (the latter will not stop it otherwise).
  * added Joerg Jaspert to the Uploaders field.
  * fix to httpd configuration to properly detect apache2 processes
  * remove numeric NNN_ from conffiles in conf.d, since it doesn't
    affect the order.
  * change the location of the embedded perl interpreter p1.pl to
    /usr/lib/nagios2.
  * a few other misc FHS related path changes.
  * added support for autodetecting the default route and creating
    a host object for it (and registering it in a seperate ucf
    managed file)
  * a few misc additions/edits to our default configuration.
  * added manpages for nagios2(8) and nagios2stats(8)

nagios2 (0rc2-2.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * re-work default configuration: split local.cfg into distinct files
    in /etc/nagios2/conf.d from debian/conf.d
  * add lintian override for resource.cfg permissions != 644
  * add linda override for outdated config.(guess|sub), we update at
    build time, keeping the new files outside of Debian .diff

nagios2 (0rc2-2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * another "not quite ready for the limelight" release to experimental,
    with nagios2-doc split off to a seperate package.  thus this will
    once again traverse NEW...

    and _will_ change in the very near future. DO NOT TRANSLATE!

  * remove boilerplate instructions from README.Debian
  * move debian/copyright to the right place
  * introduce nagios2-doc and populate it
  * add myself to uploaders

    /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/examples/rules.gz to update config.* on
    build
  * fix permissions on /var/log/nagios2 to allow web interface to
    access event log

nagios2 (0rc2-2.0-0) experimental; urgency=low

  * this version is targeted as a prelease candidate for experimental.

  [sean finney]
  * update to upstream rc2
  * after the change of course on the nagios vs nagios2 issue, a few
    (hopefully) final naming changes were made in the build process.
  * updated dependencies to reflect that nagios2 does not conflict
    with nagios 1.x.

nagios2 (0rc1-2.0-0) unreleased; urgency=low

  [sean finney]
  * initial version (closes: #341748).  until nagios2 officially releases,
    we'll use the 0$rcfoo-$version numbering scheme so that we never find
    ourselves stuck needing to muck with the epoch.
  * debconf/web configuration, via scripts borrowed from the unreleased 
    webapps-common package.
  * improvements to standard apache configuration
  * various fixes to default configuration to ensure that the
    nagios/nagios2 namespace is clearly defined.

  [marc haber]
  * lots of initial packaging work.  init script, user management, etc.
